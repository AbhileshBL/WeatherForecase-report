# WeatherForecase-report
The objective of this assignment is to develop a weather forecast application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application should retrieve weather data from an API, display it in a user-friendly interface, and provide essential features such as location-based forecasts, current weather conditions, and extended forecasts.

# Weather Forecast Application

- Current weather conditions.
- Extended 5-day forecast.
- Recent searches dropdown menu.

## Features
1. **Responsive Design**: 
   - Works seamlessly on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
2. **Search Functionality**:
   - Search weather by city name.
   - Store recently searched cities using local storage.
3. **Weather Data Display**:
   - Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
   - Includes weather icons.
4. **Extended Forecast**:
   - Provides a 5-day forecast with date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Validates user inputs and displays error messages for invalid searches or API issues.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (or another provider of your choice)
